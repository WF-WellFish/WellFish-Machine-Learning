# Well Fish Machine Learning 

## Classification of Fish Species using CNN Model
This project focuses on classifying different species of fish using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of fish images and demonstrates high accuracy and generalization capabilities.

### Project Overview
This project utilizes a CNN model to classify images of different fish species. The model is trained on a diverse dataset of fish images and evaluated to ensure high accuracy and robust performance on unseen data.

### Dataset
The dataset consists of images of various fish species divided into training, validation, and test sets. The images are preprocessed and augmented to improve model generalization.
